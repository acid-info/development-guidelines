As a creative studio within CommsHub at Logos, we use computational design and creative coding to create designs that are both functional and visually engaging as well as artworks that stand out from the res, while also providing the flexibility and scalability required for modern software development. We strive to provide and build solutions at scale for a large organization with multiple sub-business units, and this approach enables us to achieve this goal.

In page, we will provide guidelines for using computational design and creative coding in software development in the context of our studio. However, please note that creative coding and creative processes require a level of flexibility, so we encourage you to read these guidelines with your own interpretation, always feel free to bring up new ideas or questions. We understand that the best results often come from experimentation and iteration, and we are open to new approaches and ideas.
